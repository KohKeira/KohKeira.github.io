                        Chess requires strong mental resilience, the ability to remain composed even if I am losing. I have dealt with stress countless times to emerge victorious.

                        Apart from that, I also participated in the AI internship by Temasek Polytechnic. Technology is very useful in our everyday lives, and this has motivated
